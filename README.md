# [Shader Ninja](http://shallway.ninja/shaderninja)

![](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/images/glslEditor/00.gif)

Friendly 3D Game Shader Editor based on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [glslEditor](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).

It was designed to help shader programmers quickly iterate over shader development. With this tool you don't need to create a scene, material, shader, .cs files, etc. You only focus on the shader, just type in the editor and everthing will be live updated. 

## Some of the features
- Real-time updating

- Texture inspector

- DepthTexture

- Custom Render Pass

- Inline Color picker and 3D vector picker for '''vec3''

- Inline Trackpad for '''vec2'''

- Slider for floats

- Inline error display

## Electron Version

When developing use this to automatically reload Electron on every change

```bash
npm run dev
```

For use just do:

```bash
npm run start
```
