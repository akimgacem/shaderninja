# [Shader Ninja](http://shallway.ninja/shaderninja)

Friendly 3D Game Shader Editor based on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [glslEditor](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslEditor).

It was designed to help game programmers quickly iterate over shader development. With this tool you don't need to create a scene, material, shader, .cs files, etc. You only focus on the shader, just type in the editor and everthing will be live updated.
